Java makes website do stuff
html puts the stuff on the site
css makes it look nice


<br> Makes the text start a new line


If I want to make something positioned relative to another item, use position: relative;

display: flex lets you center items



alt + z : Makes it so text doesnt run off sides of coding screen


font-family: inherit;  = Makes whatever inside button use font of whatever rest of website is using
